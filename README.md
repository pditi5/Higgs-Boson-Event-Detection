# Higgs-Boson-Event-Detection
conducts EDA on a high-energy physics dataset for Higgs boson decay classification

## Inspiration & Reference

This project drew heavy inspiration from the work of Peter Sadowski and Daniel Whiteson in their insightful paper "Searching for Higgs Boson Decay Modes with Deep Learning" [1].

## The Higgs Boson Dataset
The script was working with data that originated from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ATLAS experiment, courtesy of the Learning to Discover: The Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge [2]. The dataset boasted a massive 250,000 events, each packed with details about particle collisions.
